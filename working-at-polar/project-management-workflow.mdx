title: "Project Management Workflow"
description: "How we manage issues and projects using GitHub"
---

## Context

We currently use both Linear and GitHub Issues to manage our work. The team has raised several concerns about this dual-system approach:

1. **Unordered backlog**: The support person doesn't know which issues to prioritize.
2. **Lack of transparency**: We need to be more transparent about our priorities and vision.
3. **Workflow inconsistency**: Team members follow different workflows.
4. **Tooling issues**:
   - When viewing GitHub Issues, it's difficult to relate them to Linear issues.
   - Linear and GitHub have different workflows. We have a CI action that automatically closes GitHub issues, which creates confusion.
   - etc.

## Goals

This document aims to:

1. Align the team under a single workflow
2. Track all issues (customer-reported and internal) in one place
3. Create a prioritized backlog for the support person
4. Maintain a lightweight workflow
5. Engage the community with a public roadmap and voting system

## Solution: Unify on GitHub

To address the team's concerns and meet our goals, we will deprecate Linear and consolidate all work tracking into GitHub using Issues and Projects.

### The New Workflow

One GitHub Project called **Backlog** with issues from:

| **Repo**              | **Visibility** | **Purpose**                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |
| **polar**             | 🟢 Public      | Default to public for all our features, tasks and bugs                                                      |
| **polar-internal**    | 🔒 Private     | Internal tasks we need to keep private, e.g customer-specific data, internal ops or surprise launches       |

Making it easy to coordinate our efforts in public with some exceptions in `polar-internal` only available to the team.

**Steps:**
1. Backlog: all issues that are not assigned to anyone
2. Next: the top 5 issues to be implemented by each engineer.
3. In Progress: issues that are assigned and in progress by someone
4. Done: issues that are completed

### Issue Types

We will use two primary issue types:

**Feature**
- Roadmap features that typically take more than a week to plan, design and implement, e.g Wallets, Insights, Seats.
- *Note: Create a `feat/<key>` label for grouping sub-tasks, e.g `feat/seats`*

**Task**
- A smaller deliverable (<= 1 week) that needs to be completed.
- *Note: Sub-issue of a bigger roadmap feature? Add `feat/<key>` as the label
  for grouping.*

**No type**
- New issues that need to be triaged


### Issue Labels


| Label                   | Use case                                                          |
| -----                   | --------                                                          |
| `feat/<key>`            | Group tasks by a feature grouping                                 |
| `bug`                   | An error in the service                                           |
| `votes-needed`          | Community voting for future roadmaps.                             |
| `community-request`     | Feature/task requested by the community                           |
| `support`               | A support task where a customer requested help                    |
| `docs`                  | Content or guides for our blog, docs etc                          |
| `contributor-friendly`  | Good and defined issues for new contributors                      |
| `polar-team`            | Assigned for our internal team                                    |


**Responsibilities:**
- Every engineer is responsible for creating issues, prioritizing them, and keeping them clean that are related to the project that they lead. They should also ensure that the issues are assigned to the right person and that the status is updated regularly.

## Workflow: Support

The Support workflow is more complex as it requires community interaction. We'll start simple by categorizing all issues into three types:

- **Bug**: Something is broken and needs fixing. We will use the `Task` type and the `bug` label.
- **Feature Request**: A new capability or improvement. We will use the `Feature` or `Task` depending on the size, type and `vote-needed` label.
- **Support**: A user needs help or guidance. Issue will be closed and asked to write to support@polar.com.

### Support Process Steps

The main steps are the following:

1. Triage: every new issue will be where
2. Discussion: under team review if we should implement it or not
3. Backlog: issues agreed to be implemented by the team.
4. Next: the top 10 issues to be implemented by the support engineer.
5. In Progress: the issues currently working on by the support engineer.
7. Review: opened pull requests by other team members that needs review
8. Done: the issues completed by the support engineer.

**Step 1: Triage**

The support engineer reviews issues weekly and asks:

- Is the issue clear?
- Is it a Bug, Feature Request, or Support Ticket?
- Does it already exist?

**Actions:**
- If it's a support request: ask the user to write to support@polar.com and close the issue.
- If unclear: Keep it in Triage until clarified, or close it after 14 days
- If clear and it's a feature: Move to **Discussion**
- If clear and it's a bug: Change the type to **Bug** and move to **Backlog**

**Step 2: Discussion**

Discuss with the team whether we should implement it and estimate the size:
- **S**: 1 day
- **M**: 4 days or less
- **L**: Less than 2 weeks
- **XL**: Larger than 2 weeks

Post the following Slack message in #support:

```
🆕 New Issue: [Title]
🔗 [GitHub link]
❓ Should we do it?
🗳️ Size: S (1d), M (<5d), L (<2 weeks), XL (more than 2 weeks)
```

**Actions:**
- If we don't plan to do it, document why

**Step 3: Backlog**

The backlog contains all issues we've agreed to implement, sorted by creation time.

**Step 4: Next**

The 10 most important issues to work on from the backlog. Priority is determined by:
- Community votes
- Support person's judgment
- On-call engineer's input

**Step 5: In Progress**

The issues currently working on by the support engineer.

**Step 6: Review**

Opened pull requests by other team members that needs review.

**Actions:**
- Review pull requests and provide feedback
- Merge pull requests if they are ready

**Step 7: Done**

The issues completed by the support engineer.


## Migration Plan

**Decommission Linear**
- Linear will be phased out over two weeks
- All new issues must be created in GitHub starting immediately

**Migrate Existing Issues**
- Public issues already exist in GitHub
- Private issues will be created under the `polar-internal` repository

**Support Resources**
- A quick-start guide will be provided to ensure smooth onboarding

## FAQs

**What if a private task is needed?**

Create it directly in the `polar-internal` repository and mark it as private.

**How will voting work?**

Use the 👍 GitHub reaction on issues to vote.

**How are sizes stored**

We will use a new project field called "Size" to store the size of each Task.

## Next Steps

- **Immediate**: Start creating all new issues directly in GitHub
- **Next week**: Complete migration of existing issues from Linear
- **Ongoing**: Gather feedback and continuously improve the workflow
