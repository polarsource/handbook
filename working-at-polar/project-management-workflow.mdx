title: "Project Management Workflow"
description: "How we manage issues and projects using GitHub"
---

## Context

We currently use both Linear and GitHub Issues to manage our work. The team has raised several concerns about this dual-system approach:

1. **Unordered backlog**: The support person doesn't know which issues to prioritize.
2. **Lack of transparency**: We need to be more transparent about our priorities and vision.
3. **Workflow inconsistency**: Team members follow different workflows.
4. **Tooling issues**:
   - When viewing GitHub Issues, it's difficult to relate them to Linear issues.
   - Linear and GitHub have different workflows. We have a CI action that automatically closes GitHub issues, which creates confusion.
   - etc.

## Goals

This document aims to:

1. Align the team under a single workflow
2. Track all issues (customer-reported and internal) in one place
3. Create a prioritized backlog for the support person
4. Maintain a lightweight workflow
5. Engage the community with a public roadmap and voting system

## Solution: Unify on GitHub

To address the team's concerns and meet our goals, we will deprecate Linear and consolidate all work tracking into GitHub using Issues and Projects.

### The New Workflow

We will adopt a standardized workflow across three GitHub Projects: Support, Team, and Roadmap.

| **Project** | **Visibility** | **Purpose**                                                                                     |
| ----------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Support** | üü¢ Public      | Customer-facing issues: bugs, small feature requests, and support tickets                       |
| **Team**    | üîí Private     | Internal tasks and engineering work using two repositories (`polar` and `polar-internal`)    |
| **Roadmap** | üü¢ Public      | High-level features and initiatives we're delivering                                            |

### Issue Types

We will use two primary issue types:

**Feature**
- Large chunks of work that typically take more than a week to plan, design, and implement. Wallets, Product Analytics, Seats are some examples.
- Tags:
  - `#votes-needed` - Feature not yet planned
  - `#community-request` - Feature requested by the community

**Task**
- A deliverable that needs to be completed. Can be a sub-issue of a feature or standalone
- Tags:
  - `#bug` - An error in the system
  - `#support` - A support task where a customer requested help
  - `#votes-needed` - A small feature that hasn't been planned yet
  - `#community-request` - A feature requested by the community
  - `#contributor-friendly` - Tasks the community can participate in (support person should review these)

**No type**
- New issues that need to be triaged

## Workflow: Team Project

The Team project is what we'll use daily as engineers to track our initiatives and tasks. This project shows:

1. Features and Tasks we are currently working on
2. The backlog of remaining work

**Responsibilities:**
- Every engineer or initiative lead is responsible for creating issues, prioritizing them, and keeping them clean

**Repositories:**
- Most issues will be public under the `polarsource/polar` repository
- Private tasks or initiatives should be created under `polarsource/polar-internal`

## Workflow: Support

The Support workflow is more complex as it requires community interaction. We'll start simple by categorizing all issues into three types:

- **Bug**: Something is broken and needs fixing. We will use the `Task` type and the `bug` label.
- **Feature Request**: A new capability or improvement. We will use the `Feature` or `Task` depending on the size, type and `vote-needed` label.
- **Support**: A user needs help or guidance

### Support Process Steps

**Step 1: Triage**

The support engineer reviews issues weekly and asks:

- Is the issue clear?
- Is it a Bug, Feature Request, or Support Ticket?
- Does it already exist?

**Actions:**
- If it's a support request: Change the type to **Support** and move to **In Progress**
- If unclear: Keep it in Triage until clarified, or close it after 14 days
- If clear and it's a feature: Move to **Discussion**
- If clear and it's a bug: Change the type to **Bug** and move to **Backlog**

**Step 2: Discussion**

Discuss with the team whether we should implement it and estimate the size:
- **S**: 1 day
- **M**: 1 week (5 days)
- **L**: Larger than a week

Post the following Slack message in #support:

```
üÜï New Issue: [Title]
üîó [GitHub link]
‚ùì Should we do it?
üó≥Ô∏è Size: S (1d), M (5d), L (bigger)
```

**Actions:**
- If we don't plan to do it, document why
- If the size is **L**, move the issue to Roadmap > Backlog

**Step 3: Backlog**

The backlog contains all issues we've agreed to implement, sorted by creation time.

**Step 4: Next**

The 10 most important issues to work on from the backlog. Priority is determined by:
- Community votes
- Support person's judgment
- On-call engineer's input

## Workflow: Roadmap

The Roadmap is public and shows the initiatives we plan to work on.

**Contents:**
1. Internal initiatives created by the team
2. Large feature requests from customers

**Columns:**
1. **Backlog** - All initiatives
2. **Next** - The next initiatives we will work on
3. **In Progress** - Current initiatives being worked on
4. **Done** - Completed initiatives

**Ownership:**
- Primary owner: Birk
- Initiative owners keep their sections updated
- Priorities are discussed ad-hoc in meetings or during onsites

## Migration Plan

**Decommission Linear**
- Linear will be phased out over two weeks
- All new issues must be created in GitHub starting immediately

**Migrate Existing Issues**
- Public issues already exist in GitHub
- Private issues will be created under the `polar-internal` repository

**Support Resources**
- A quick-start guide will be provided to ensure smooth onboarding

## FAQs

**What if a private task is needed?**

Create it directly in the `polar-internal` repository and mark it as private.

**How will voting work?**

Use the üëç GitHub reaction on issues to vote.

## Next Steps

- **Immediate**: Start creating all new issues directly in GitHub
- **Next week**: Complete migration of existing issues from Linear
- **Ongoing**: Gather feedback and continuously improve the workflow
