## Workflow

One GitHub Project called **Backlog** with issues from:

| **Repo**              | **Visibility** | **Purpose**                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |
| **polar**             | 🟢 Public      | Default to public for all our features, tasks and bugs                                                      |
| **polar-internal**    | 🔒 Private     | Internal tasks we need to keep private, e.g customer-specific data, internal ops or surprise launches       |

Making it easy to coordinate our efforts in public with some exceptions in `polar-internal` only available to the team.

**Steps:**
1. Backlog: all issues that are not assigned to anyone
2. Next: the top 5 issues to be implemented by each engineer.
3. In Progress: issues that are assigned and in progress by someone
4. Done: issues that are completed

### Issue Types

We will use two primary issue types:

**Feature**
- Roadmap features that typically take more than a week to plan, design and implement, e.g Wallets, Insights, Seats.
- *Note: Create a `feat/<key>` label for grouping sub-tasks, e.g `feat/seats`*

**Task**
- A smaller deliverable (<= 1 week) that needs to be completed.
- *Note: Sub-issue of a bigger roadmap feature? Add `feat/<key>` as the label
  for grouping.*

**No type**
- New issues that need to be triaged

### Issue Labels

| Label                   | Use case                                                          |
| -----                   | --------                                                          |
| `feat/<key>`            | Group tasks by a feature grouping                                 |
| `bug`                   | An error in the service                                           |
| `votes-needed`          | Community voting for future roadmaps.                             |
| `community-request`     | Feature/task requested by the community                           |
| `contributor-friendly`  | Good and defined issues for new contributors                      |
| `polar-team`            | Assigned for our internal team                                    |
| `support-week`          | Issue assigned for an engineers support week                      |
| `content`               | Content or guides for our blog, docs etc                          |


**Responsibilities:**
- Every engineer is responsible for creating issues, prioritizing them, and keeping them clean that are related to the project that they lead. They should also ensure that the issues are assigned to the right person and that the status is updated regularly.

**Support week:**
All engineers during on-call have support week. Focusing on prioritized bugs, enhancements or smaller feature requests oveheard from our community recently. Such issues are labeled `support-week`. We strive to have ~5 such issues at a time.

## JIT Planning & Backlog

We don't believe in long-term roadmaps. As a startup, we ship and adapt fast based on learnings and new insights. We have an internal, high-level, idea of bigger long-term initiatives and sequencing that need to come into play. However, historically, trying to map it into a 3-9 month roadmap has never been successful - it quickly becomes outdated. 

So instead, we work by:
1. Having a high-level North Star internally to formalize long-term vision
2. JIT planning for the next 1-2 months ahead

### Feature Requests & Prioritization

The main steps are the following:

1. **Triage**: every new community issue or feature requests starts here
2. **Discussion**: under team review and potentially 
3. **Backlog**: issues we're aligned with, but have not planned 
4. **Planned**: issues we plan to do within the next 1-2 months (JIT)
5. **Next**: prioritized issues up next
6. **In Progress**: the issues currently being worked on.
7. **Review**: opened pull requests by other team members that needs review
8. **Done**

**Step 1: Triage**

The support engineer reviews issues weekly and asks:

- Is the issue clear?
- Is it a Bug, Feature Request, or Support Ticket?
- Does it already exist?

**Actions:**
- If it's a support request: ask the user to write to support@polar.com and close the issue.
- If unclear: Keep it in Triage until clarified, or close it after 14 days
- If clear and it's a feature: Move to **Discussion**
- If clear and it's a bug: Change the type to **Bug** and move to **Backlog**

**Step 2: Discussion**

Discuss with the team whether we should implement it and estimate the size:
- **Day**: <= Day of effort
- **Week**: <= Week of effort
- **Sprint**: <= 2 Weeks of effort
- **Month**: Several weeks of effort. Bigger than 1 month? Let's try to break it into chunks.

Combined with clarifying how we would approach it at a high-level. E.g we understand the underlying desire with the feature request, but might have other ideas on how to best tackle it.

Post the following Slack message in #support:

```
🆕 New Issue: [Title]
🔗 [GitHub link]
❓ Should we do it?
🗳️ Size: Day (1d), Week (<5d), Sprint (<2 weeks), Month (more than 2 weeks)
```

**Actions:**
- If we don't plan to do it, document why

**Step 3: Backlog**

The backlog contains all issues we're aligned on implementing, sorted by creation time.

**Step 4: Planned**

The backlog contains all issues we're aligned on implementing based on factors like:
- Community votes
- Support feedback
- Internal review and prioritization
- Long-term vision: Balancing tablestakes vs. innovation

**Step 5: Next**

Prioritized issues to work on next. Managed by all engineers individually.

**Step 6: In Progress**

Issues that are being actively worked on now.

**Step 7: Review**

Opened pull requests by other team members that needs review.

**Actions:**
- Review pull requests and provide feedback
- Merge pull requests if they are ready

**Step 8: Done**

The issues is completed.
