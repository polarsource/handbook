So, what's like working at Polar?

# We're remote
All employees are remote, which means we don't have a physical office. Instead, we use video conferencing and messaging tools to communicate and collaborate with each other.

# We love open source
We believe in open source, it's in our DNA. We contributed to open source projects, use open source tools, and we build on public. Check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/polarsource/polar)

# We're transparent
We're transparent, which means we share information and ideas freely. We believe in open communication and collaboration, which allows us to learn from each other and improve our work. That's why almost all our documentation and processes are public.

# We're autonomous
We're autonomous, which means we have the freedom to make decisions and take ownership of our work. We believe in self-organization and self-management, which allows us to work efficiently and effectively.

# We're async
We don't have a fixed schedule and meetings. We believe in asynchronous communication and collaboration, which allows us to work at our own pace and in our own time.
