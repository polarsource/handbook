Welcome to the engineering team at Polar! This handbook covers our engineering practices, principles, and processes.

## Our Tech Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Next.js
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Render
- **Tools**: GitHub, Linear, Slack

### Development Workflow
1. **Planning**: Features planned in Linear
2. **Development**: Feature branches, regular commits, AI-assisted coding
3. **Review**: Rewview design docs and critical pull requests
4. **Testing**: Automated tests + manual QA
5. **Deployment**: A CI and CD pipeline for automated deployment.

## What Makes Us Different

### AI-First Development
- We embrace AI tools for coding, debugging, and problem-solving
- Expected to use AI effectively, not replace human judgment
- Focus on prompt engineering and AI collaboration skills

### Practical Over Perfect
- Working software beats perfect architecture
- Technical debt is managed, not avoided entirely

### Small Team, Big Impact
- Every engineer has significant influence on product direction
- Direct access to users and business metrics
- Opportunity to work across the full stack

### Build on public
- Every design document and code is publicly available for review and feedback
- Iterate based on real user feedback
