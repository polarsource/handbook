# On-call log

Every week, another engineer will be on-call. They will be responsible for responding to alerts and incidents.
When everything is running smoothly, the on-call engineer can handle maintenance tasks like updating dependencies, fixing bugs, and improving the codebase.

The goal of this rolling log is to ease handover between on-call for unresolved issues, and keep a log of what's been handled recently.
