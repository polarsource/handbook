# On-call log

Every week, another engineer will be on-call. They will be responsible for responding to alerts and incidents.
When everything is running smoothly, the on-call engineer can handle maintenance tasks like updating dependencies, fixing bugs, and improving the codebase.

The goal of this rolling log is to ease handover between on-call for unresolved issues, and keep a log of what's been handled recently.

## Week of 2025-09-29

On-call: Pieter Beulque

### Ongoing issues

- Rishi asked me to look into the Nuxt adapter, I still have to set up a reproduction.

### Resolved issues

- Updated the JS SDK & adapters to fix a few bugs, mainly with our Better Auth adapter and Vite builds. It's hard to test locally (I may take a shot at improving this if I have some time this week), but I think I squashed the most blocking bugs.

### Maintenance

- Updated Tailwind to v4
- Updated Next.js to v15 (and so, also React to v19). This was a bit scary, since we don't have good front-end tests, so we'll have to monitor Sentry closely for a while.
- Fixed the tests & CI on `polar-adapters`
