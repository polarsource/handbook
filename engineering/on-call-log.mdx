# On-call log

Every week, another engineer will be on-call. They will be responsible for responding to alerts and incidents.
When everything is running smoothly, the on-call engineer can handle maintenance tasks like updating dependencies, fixing bugs, and improving the codebase.

The goal of this rolling log is to ease handover between on-call for unresolved issues, and keep a log of what's been handled recently.

## Week of 2025-09-29

On-call: Pieter Beulque

### Ongoing issues

_None_

### Resolved issues

- Updated the JS SDK & adapters to fix a few bugs, mainly with our Better Auth adapter and Vite builds. It's hard to test locally (I may take a shot at improving this if I have some time this week), but I think I squashed the most blocking bugs.
- On October 1st, I noticed we hit a lot of 429's since the upgrade to Next.js 15. Our hypothesis is that the `/ingest` routes (for Posthog) started running the middleware before executing (even though this isn't documented new behavior in Next.js 15), so I added `ingest` to the ignored paths regex for that middleware.

### Maintenance

- Updated Tailwind to v4
- Updated Next.js to v15 (and so, also React to v19). This was a bit scary, since we don't have good front-end tests, so we'll have to monitor Sentry closely for a while.
  - As part of the React 19 migration, I removed all `forwardRef` calls since that's deprecated syntax. Things look like they're working, but if some interactive element or an infinite scroll or sth stopped working, this is probably related.
- Updated Rechars to v3
- Fixed the tests & CI on `polar-adapters`
