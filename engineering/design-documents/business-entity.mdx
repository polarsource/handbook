## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations

1. **Ambiguous Event Attribution**: When a customer belongs to multiple seat-based subscriptions from different organizations (e.g., Alice works for both Acme and Slack), events lack business context to determine which customer should be billed.
2. **Inflexible Billing Management**: Changing the billing manager becomes tricky because billing information (payment methods, orders) is tied to a single Customer entity.
3. **No Business-Level Aggregation**: When a business has multiple subscriptions from the same merchant, it's difficult to aggregate usage or provide consolidated billing.

### Requirements

1. **Subscription Visibility**: Know what subscriptions a business customer has
2. **Billing Transfer**: Allow transfer of subscriptions to another billing manager
3. **Clear Attribution**: Easily know who is the billing customer of an event
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing B2C integrations must continue working without changes

### Current Merchant Workflows (Must Preserve)

#### Workflow A: Public Checkout (B2C - Current)
1. Customer visits merchant site, clicks checkout link
2. Polar Checkout: Buyer enters email + card
3. Polar auto-creates individual customer
4. Post-purchase: Customer manages subscription via Customer Portal

#### Workflow B: Public Checkout (B2B - Current seats flow)
1. Customer visits merchant site, clicks checkout link
2. Polar Checkout: Buyer enters email + card
3. Polar auto-creates billing manager
4. Post-purchase: Buyer invites team members, manages via Customer Portal

#### Workflow C: Checkout Sessions (API-driven)
1. Merchant app creates customer and business in their system
2. Merchant creates Polar customer + business inside Polar via API
3. Billing manager clicks checkout in merchant app
4. Polar Checkout: Pre-filled information, enters card
5. Returns to merchant app (optional: Customer Portal access)

## Solution

We evaluated two architectural approaches. Both solve the core problem but differ in complexity, migration risk, and developer experience.

### Tenets

These tenets guide our decision-making, weighted by importance:

1. **Billing Accuracy** (weight: 7) - Charge the right customer, events hit correct paying customer
2. **Backward Compatibility** (weight: 6) - Existing B2C and B2B customers continue working unchanged.
3. **Simplicity** (weight: 5) - Seamless checkout, straightforward queries, simple event ingestion
4. **Minimal Changes for B2B** (weight: 4) - Merchants make minimal changes when adding B2B
5. **Polar Developer Experience** (weight: 3) - Avoid excessive filtering or complex queries
6. **WorkOS/Auth0 Integration** (weight: 2) - Support enterprise identity providers

Scale: 🔴 1 (poor) | 🟡 2 (acceptable) | 🟢 3 (excellent)

### Option 1: Beneficiary Model

**Concept**: Introduce a `Beneficiary` entity that represents "who uses the product". `Customer` becomes purely a billing entity. Every Customer has one or more Beneficiaries - even individual customers have a single beneficiary (themselves). This creates uniform architecture with no special cases.

**High-Level Architecture**:
```
Customer (id, name, stripe_customer_id)  # Pure billing entity
  ├─ Subscriptions
  ├─ Orders
  ├─ PaymentMethods
  └─ Beneficiaries → Who uses/accesses the product

Beneficiary (id, customer_id, email, name, role)  # Pure usage entity
  ├─ BenefitGrants (what they can access)
  ├─ Events (what they did)
  ├─ CustomerSeats (seats they claimed)
  └─ CustomerSessions (how they authenticate)
```

**Key Insight**: Uniform 1:N relationship everywhere
```
Customer (Alice Personal)
  └── Beneficiary (Alice) [1:1 for individuals]

Customer (ACME Corp)
  ├── Beneficiary (Alice at ACME - it's different beneficiary ID than other Alice)
  ├── Beneficiary (Bob at ACME)
  └── Beneficiary (Carol at ACME)

Customer (Lolo Inc)
  ├── Beneficiary (Alice at Lolo - it's different beneficiary ID than other Alice)
  └── Beneficiary (Dan at Lolo)
```



**Scoring**:
| Tenet                   | Score | Rationale |
| ----------------------- | ----- | --------- |
| Billing Accuracy        | 🟢 3  | Perfect separation - Customer = billing, Beneficiary = usage |
| Backward Compatibility  | 🔴 1  | Current integration with B2B requires migration |
| Simplicity              | 🟢 3  | Uniform 1:N model, no type discrimination, no special cases |
| Minimal B2B Changes     | 🟢 3  | Just add beneficiaries, existing customer_id queries work |
| Polar Dev Experience    | 🟢 3  | Clean queries, no type filtering, clear separation |
| WorkOS Integration      | 🟢 3  | Beneficiaries map directly to WorkOS users/members |
| **Weighted Total**      | **69** | |

**Pros**:
- **No polymorphism**: Customer is always billing entity, no `type` field needed
- **Uniform API**: All authentication goes through Beneficiary, single code path
- **Easy multi-membership**: Alice has multiple beneficiary records (personal, ACME, Lolo). Each one has a different ID.
- **Clean separation**: Customer = billing, Beneficiary = usage/access
- **Perfect WorkOS fit**: Beneficiaries map 1:1 to WorkOS users/members

**Cons**:
- Extra entity for every user.
- More joins for some queries (beneficiary -> customer)
- Conceptual shift: "authenticate as beneficiary, not customer"

---

### Option 2: Customer Type + Member

**Concept**: Extend existing `Customer` entity with a `type` discriminator field (`individual` | `business`). Business customers have Members (a separate junction table) linking to individual customers. Single Customer entity for both billing and usage.

**High-Level Architecture**:
```
Customer (id, email, name, type: individual|business)
  ├─ Subscriptions (any customer can have subscriptions)
  ├─ Orders (any customer can have orders)
  ├─ PaymentMethods (any customer can have payment methods)
  ├─ Events (individuals generate, businesses pay)
  ├─ CustomerSeats (individuals claim seats)
  ├─ BenefitGrants (individuals receive benefits)
  └─ CustomerSessions (individuals authenticate)

Member (business_customer_id, individual_customer_id, role)
  ├─ Links business to individual members
  └─ Roles: admin, billing_manager, member
```


*Backward compatibility:*
- **ZERO BREAKING CHANGES**: All existing API calls work identically
- `type` defaults to `"individual"` if not specified
- Existing customers auto-migrated to `type="individual"`
- B2B features are opt-in via `type="business"` parameter

**Scoring**:
| Tenet                   | Score | Rationale |
| ----------------------- | ----- | --------- |
| Billing Accuracy        | 🟡 2  | Customer serves dual purpose, but naming conventions mitigate |
| Backward Compatibility  | 🟢 3  | Zero breaking changes, additive-only schema |
| Simplicity              | 🟡 2  | Single entity concept, but polymorphism adds query complexity |
| Minimal B2B Changes     | 🟡 2  | Just add `type` parameter, similar code patterns |
| Polar Dev Experience    | 🟡 2  | Requires type filtering, mitigated by SQLAlchemy polymorphism |
| WorkOS Integration      | 🟢 3  | Individual customers map cleanly to WorkOS users |
| **Weighted Total**      | **62** | |

**Pros**:
- Minimal schema changes (add one field, one table)
- Zero breaking changes for existing merchants
- Lower migration risk (additive-only)
- "A customer is a customer" - simpler mental model

**Cons**:
- Type discrimination in queries (mitigated by SQLAlchemy polymorphism)
- Customer entity serves dual purpose (usage + billing)
- Need clear naming conventions to avoid confusion

```

**Key Points:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Customer = billing entity, Beneficiary = usage/access entity
- **No Polymorphism**: Customer table has no `type` discriminator, always represents billing
- **1:1 for B2C**: Individual customers have 1 default beneficiary
- **1:N for B2B**: Business customers have N beneficiaries (team members)
- **Unique Constraint**: `(customer_id, email)` on Beneficiary allows same email across different beneficiares.
- **Event Attribution**: Events always reference `beneficiary_id` (never ambiguous across business. It can be ambiguous across the same business with multiple subscriptions)
- **Denormalization**: `customer_id` kept in usage tables for query performance (optional)
- **Authentication**: Customer portal sessions authenticate as Beneficiary, not Customer
- **Backward Compatibility**: Service layer accepts both `customer_id` (resolves to default beneficiary) and `beneficiary_id`

---

### Appendix F: Event Attribution Strategy

This appendix details how we handle event attribution in B2B scenarios.

**Problem**: When an individual customer is a member of multiple businesses, which subscription should be billed for their usage events?

**Solution**: Use `subscription_id` (optional) with automatic inference.

#### Inference Logic

```python
async def infer_subscription(customer: IndividualCustomer) -> UUID:
    """Infer which subscription to bill for this customer's event."""

    # Get all business memberships
    memberships = await get_memberships_with_subscriptions(customer)

    if len(memberships) == 0:
        # Individual B2C customer - use their own subscription
        if customer.subscriptions:
            return customer.subscriptions[0].id
        else:
            raise BadRequest("Customer has no active subscriptions")

    elif len(memberships) == 1:
        # Member of exactly ONE business - unambiguous
        _, subscription = memberships[0]
        return subscription.id

    else:
        # Member of MULTIPLE businesses - ambiguous, require explicit subscription_id
        raise BadRequest(
            f"Customer is member of {len(memberships)} businesses. "
            f"Specify 'subscription_id' parameter."
        )
```

#### Edge Cases

**Case 1**: Alice has her own B2C subscription AND is a member of Acme Corp
- **Inference**: Fails (2 possible subscriptions)
- **Merchant action**: Must specify `subscription_id`

**Case 2**: Bob is a member of Acme AND Slack
- **Inference**: Fails (2 business subscriptions)
- **Merchant action**: Must specify `subscription_id`

**Case 3**: Charlie is only a member of Acme
- **Inference**: Success (only 1 subscription)
- **Merchant action**: No action needed, auto-inferred

#### API Error Response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "ambiguous_subscription",
    "message": "Customer cust_alice_123 belongs to 2 subscriptions. Specify 'subscription_id'.",
    "details": {
      "customer_id": "cust_alice_123",
      "available_subscriptions": [
        {
          "subscription_id": "sub_personal_456",
          "type": "individual",
          "product": "prod_theme_basic"
        },
        {
          "subscription_id": "sub_acme_789",
          "type": "business",
          "business_customer_id": "cust_acme_123",
          "product": "prod_theme_pro"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Merchants can then prompt the user or maintain context in their app to track which subscription is active.

### Appendix H: Complete Integration Flows (Side-by-Side Comparison)

This appendix shows how merchants integrate with Polar for common workflows, comparing **Option 1 (Beneficiary Model)** vs **Option 2 (Customer Type + Member)** side-by-side.

---

#### Flow 1: Create B2C Customer

##### Option 1: Beneficiary Model

```http
POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/customers
Authorization: Bearer polar_secret_...
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "external_id": "alice_001",
  "organization_id": "org_abc123"
}
```

**Response 201:**
```json
{
  "id": "cust_alice_123",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "external_id": "alice_001",
  "organization_id": "org_abc123",
  "beneficiaries": [
    {
      "id": "ben_alice_456",
      "email": "alice@example.com",
      "name": "Alice Smith",
      "role": "admin"
    }
  ]
}
```

**What Happens:**
- Creates 1 Customer (billing entity)
- Auto-creates 1 Beneficiary (usage entity) with same email
- Beneficiary linked to customer

---

##### Option 2: Customer Type + Member

```http
POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/customers
Authorization: Bearer polar_secret_...
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "external_id": "alice_001",
  "organization_id": "org_abc123"
  // type defaults to "individual"
}
```

**Response 201:**
```json
{
  "id": "cust_alice_123",
  "type": "individual",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "external_id": "alice_001",
  "organization_id": "org_abc123"
}
```

**What Happens:**
- Creates 1 Customer with `type="individual"` (default)
- No separate Member entity needed for individuals

---

**Key Difference:**
- **Option 1**: Always creates Customer + Beneficiary (uniform 1:N model)
- **Option 2**: Creates only Customer, type discriminates individual vs business

---

#### Flow 2: Create B2B Customer with Billing Manager

**Key Difference:**
- **Option 1**: Beneficiaries don't exist outside the Customer.
- **Option 2**: Individual customers exist independently.

```

---

**Key Difference:**
- **Option 1**: Benefit grant links to `beneficiary_id`
- **Option 2**: Benefit grant links to `customer_id` (individual customer)

#### Flow 5: Seat-Based Product with Checkout Links (Public)

**Scenario**: Public checkout link for team subscription - auto-creates business on checkout.

##### Option 1: Beneficiary Model

```http
# Merchant shares public checkout link
https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_gon2ISU4r7oYyjVaxXlRVUv5MKh1H3c1gCxKn1zZGHA

        }
      ]
    },
    "product_id": "prod_team_plan",

  }
}
```

##### Option 2: Customer Type + Member

```http
# Merchant shares public checkout link
https://polar.sh/org_abc/products/prod_team_plan

# Customer clicks, enters email, completes purchase

**Key Difference:**
- **Option 1**: Single customer created
- **Option 2**: Two customers created, one business and one individual

#### Flow 6: Download Benefits

##### Flow 6a: B2C Customer Download Benefit

**Scenario**: Bob (individual customer) access to a downloadable benefit.

###### Option 1: Beneficiary Model

```http
# Bob authenticates via Customer Portal
# Session identifies him by customer_id (B2C backward compatibility as 1 beneficiary == 1 customer in B2C)

# B2C: Using customer_id (backward compatible)
GET https://api.polar.sh/v1/customer-portal/downloadables
Authorization: Bearer polar_customer_session_...

```

**Response (same for both):**
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "grant_001",
      "beneficiary_id": "ben_bob_default_456",  // Auto-created default beneficiary
      "customer_id": "cust_bob_123",  // Same as billing customer
      "file": {
        "id": "benefit_theme_download",
        "name": "Premium Theme Package"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**How B2C Compatibility Works:**
- Customer session endpoints accepts both `customer_id` (legacy) and `beneficiary_id` (new)
- B2C customers have auto-created "default" beneficiary (1:1 mapping)
- `customer_id=cust_bob_123` internally resolves to `beneficiary_id=ben_bob_default_456`

---

##### Flow 6b: B2B Team Member Claims Benefit

> ⚠️ This contains a breaking change with seats functionality

**Scenario**: Alice (team member at ACME) claims access to a downloadable benefit.

###### Option 1: Beneficiary Model

```http
# Alice authenticates via Customer Portal
# Session identifies her as ben_alice_acme_123 (B2B: explicit beneficiary)

GET https://api.polar.sh/v1/benefit-grants?beneficiary_id=ben_alice_acme_123
Authorization: Bearer polar_beneficiary_session_...
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "grant_002",
      "beneficiary_id": "ben_alice_acme_123",
      "customer_id": "cust_acme_456",  // ACME Inc (business) paid for it
      "benefit": {
        "id": "benefit_theme_download",
        "type": "downloadable",
        "description": "Premium Theme Package"
      },
      "subscription_id": "sub_acme_789"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key B2B Difference:**
- ❌ Cannot use `customer_id` query param for B2B (ambiguous - which beneficiary?)
- ✅ Must use `beneficiary_id` to identify which team member
- ✅ Authentication token contains beneficiary context

---

###### Option 2: Customer Type + Member

```http
# Alice authenticates via Customer Portal
# Session identifies her as cust_alice_123 (individual customer)

GET https://api.polar.sh/v1/customer-portal/downloadables
Authorization: Bearer polar_customer_session_...
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "grant_001",
      "customer_id": "cust_alice_123",
      "file": {
        "id": "benefit_theme_download",
        "name": "Premium Theme Package"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

```http
# Download benefit
GET https://api.polar.sh/v1/benefits/benefit_theme_download/download
Authorization: Bearer polar_customer_session_...
```

---

**Key Differences:**
- **Option 1 (B2C)**: `customer_id` backward compatible, internally maps to default beneficiary
- **Option 1 (B2B)**: ⚠️ Uses `beneficiary_id` for explicit team member identification
- **Option 2**: Always uses `customer_id` (individual customer for both B2C and B2B members)

---

#### Flow 7: Customer Portal Link Generation

##### Flow 7a: B2C Customer Portal

**Scenario**: Bob (individual customer) needs to access Customer Portal to manage his subscription.

###### Option 1: Beneficiary Model

```http
# Option A: Using customer_id (B2C backward compatible)
POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/customer-sessions
Authorization: Bearer polar_secret_...

{
  "customer_id": "cust_bob_123"  // ✅ B2C backward compatible
}

# Option B: Using beneficiary_id (new explicit way)
POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/customer-sessions
Authorization: Bearer polar_secret_...

{
  "beneficiary_id": "ben_bob_default_456"  // ✅ New way
}
```

**Response (same for both):**
```json
{
  "token": "polar_cst_abc123xyz",
  "customer_id": "cust_bob_123",
  "beneficiary_id": "ben_bob_default_456",  // Auto-resolved from customer
  "return_url": "https://polar.sh/org_merchant/portal?token=polar_cst_abc123xyz",
  "expires_at": "2025-12-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**How B2C Compatibility Works:**
- ✅ Endpoint accepts both `customer_id` (legacy) and `beneficiary_id` (new)
- ✅ If `customer_id` provided → resolve to default beneficiary → create session
- ✅ If `beneficiary_id` provided → create session directly

**Portal shows:**
- Bob's subscriptions (from customer_id: cust_bob_123)
- Bob's benefit grants (from beneficiary_id: ben_bob_default_456)
- Bob's orders and invoices

---

###### Option 2: Customer Type + Member

```http
POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/customer-sessions
Authorization: Bearer polar_secret_...

{
  "customer_id": "cust_bob_456"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "token": "polar_cst_abc123xyz",
  "customer_id": "cust_bob_456",
  "return_url": "https://polar.sh/org_merchant/portal?token=polar_cst_abc123xyz",
  "expires_at": "2025-12-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Portal shows:**
- Bob's subscriptions
- Bob's benefit grants
- Bob's orders and invoices

---

##### Flow 7b: B2B Customer Portal


**Scenario**: Jane (billing manager at Acme) needs to see company billing info.

###### Option 1: Beneficiary Model

> ⚠️ This contains a breaking change with seats functionality


We can only use the beneficiary id. The customerId has multiple benefficieres and we don't know which one to pick.

```http
POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/customer-sessions
Authorization: Bearer polar_secret_...

{
  "beneficiary_id": "ben_jane_789"  // Jane's beneficiary at Acme
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "token": "polar_cst_def456",
  "beneficiary_id": "ben_jane_789",
  "customer_id": "cust_acme_123",
  "url": "https://polar.sh/portal?token=polar_cst_def456",
  "expires_at": "2025-12-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Portal shows (role-based on beneficiary.role = "billing_manager"):**
- Acme's subscriptions (from customer_id)
- All beneficiaries (list all team members)
- Company orders and invoices
- Aggregated usage across all beneficiaries

---

###### Option 2: Customer Type + Member

```http
POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/customer-sessions
Authorization: Bearer polar_secret_...

{
  "customer_id": "cust_jane_456"  // Jane's individual customer
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "token": "polar_cst_def456",
  "customer_id": "cust_jane_456",
  "url": "https://polar.sh/portal?token=polar_cst_def456",
  "expires_at": "2025-12-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Portal logic:**
1. Check if cust_jane_456 is a member of any business customers
2. Find member record: business_customer_id = cust_acme_123, role = "billing_manager"
3. Show billing manager view

**Portal shows:**
- Acme's subscriptions (from business customer)
- All members (query members of cust_acme_123)
- Company orders and invoices
- Aggregated usage across all members

---

**Key Difference:**
- **Option 1**: ⚠️ Single `beneficiary_id` gives access to both personal and business context. Not compatible with B2B.
- **Option 2**: `customer_id` requires lookup via Member table to find business context.

---

#### Flow 9: Event Ingestion

##### Flow 9a: B2C Event Ingestion

**Scenario**: Bob (individual customer) makes an API call - track usage.

###### Option 1: Beneficiary Model

```http
# Option A: Using customer_id (B2C backward compatible)
POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/events
Authorization: Bearer polar_secret_...

{
  "customer_id": "cust_bob_123",  // ✅ B2C backward compatible
  "name": "api.request",
  "properties": {
    "endpoint": "/v1/themes",
    "method": "POST"
  }
}

# Option B: Using beneficiary_id (new explicit way)
POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/events
Authorization: Bearer polar_secret_...

{
  "beneficiary_id": "ben_bob_default_456",  // ✅ New way
  "name": "api.request",
  "properties": {
    "endpoint": "/v1/themes",
    "method": "POST"
  }
}
```

**Response (same for both):**
201

**How B2C Compatibility Works:**
- Endpoint accepts both `customer_id` (legacy) and `beneficiary_id` (new)
- If `customer_id` provided → resolve to default beneficiary → record event
- If `beneficiary_id` provided → record event directly

---

###### Option 2: Customer Type + Member

```http
POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/events
Authorization: Bearer polar_secret_...

{
  "customer_id": "cust_bob_456",
  "name": "api.request",
  "properties": {
    "endpoint": "/v1/themes",
    "method": "POST"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
201

---

##### Flow 9b: B2B Event Ingestion

> ⚠️ This contains a breaking change with seats functionality

**Scenario**: Alice (team member at Acme) makes an API call - bill Acme's subscription.

###### Option 1: Beneficiary Model

```http
POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/events
Authorization: Bearer polar_secret_...

{
  "customer_id": "cust_acme_123", // the business customer of the subscription, who to bill. ⚠️ This breaks current seats usage as merchants will need to pass a new customer ID or use the new benefficiaryId
  "beneficiary_id": "ben_alice_acme_123",  // Optional: Alice's beneficiary at Acme for granular usage
  "name": "api.request",
  "properties": {
    "endpoint": "/v1/themes",
    "method": "POST"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
201

**What happens:**
- Bills Acme's subscription

---

###### Option 2: Customer Type + Member

```http
POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/events
Authorization: Bearer polar_secret_...

{
  "customer_id": "cust_alice_123",  // Alice's individual customer
  "name": "api.request",
  "properties": {
    "endpoint": "/v1/themes",
    "method": "POST"
  }
}
```

**What happens:**
- Polar checks if cust_alice_123 is a member of any businesses
- Finds member record: business_customer_id = cust_acme_456
- If Alice is member of ONLY ONE business and doesn't have a subscription, we will bill that business

**Response (if Alice is member of only Acme):**
201

**Response (if Alice is member of Acme AND Lolo):**
```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "ambiguous_subscription",
    "message": "Customer cust_alice_123 is a member of 2 businesses. Specify 'subscription_id'.",
    "details": {
      "available_subscriptions": [
        {"subscription_id": "sub_acme_789", "business": "Acme Corp"},
        {"subscription_id": "sub_lolo_456", "business": "Lolo Inc"}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Retry with explicit subscription:**
```http
POST https://api.polar.sh/v1/events
{
  "customer_id": "cust_alice_123",
  "subscription_id": "sub_acme_789",  // Explicit
  "name": "api.request"
}
```

#### Flow 10: Customer Portal Login

The user access: https://polar.sh/petru-test/portal/request

##### Flow 10.a: B2C login

In both cases work as expected.
 
##### Flow 10.b: B2B login

###### Option 1: Beneficiary Model

Beneficiary emails are not unique across per organization, they are unique per Customer. This means that a single email address can be associated with multiple beneficiaries within the same organization.

These are different entities that can be associated with the same email address.

###### Option 2: Customer Type + Member

Every customer has a unique email address. This means that a single email address, but they can have subscriptions attached to them and being a member of multiple business customers.
