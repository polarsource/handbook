HERE BE DRAGONS

## Solution A: Direct connection to DB

1. Add your IP to the allowlist in the database settings Render in [the “Access Control”-section](https://dashboard.render.com/) of the `db`-instance
2. Connect directly to the database using the database environment variables in Render

## Solution B: SSH connection

1. Add your SSH public key to your Render user in the Account Settings and going to “SSH public keys” and adding your public key there
2. Check that you are able to connect by doing `ssh {FIND_ON_RENDER}`. This command is the one that is shown if you click on **Connect** on the service page:  https://dashboard.render.com/web/{DB}
3. Now in Postico or TablePlus, create a new connection and check the “Use SSH tunnel”. Plug in
    1. Server name: `ssh.ohio.render.com`
    2. User name: `{FIND_ON_RENDER}`
    3. Private key: <select the private key corresponding to the public key you uploaded>
4. In the same connection plug in the hostname, username, password, and database from the Render environment variables
5. You should be good to go!
