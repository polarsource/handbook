# Trigger Webhooks

## Context

If BetterStack is mentioning that Webhooks monitor is failing, it's likely due to an error in the webhook delivery process. This could be caused by a variety of factors, such as network issues, server downtime, or misconfigured webhook settings.

First, fix the issue causing the failure. Then, follow this procedure to trigger the webhooks manually.

## When to Use

- Webhooks monitors fails on BetterStack

## Prerequisites

- SSH access to Render services
- Webhook event timestamps or date range

## Procedure

### Step 1: SSH into Render Service

Connect to the main application service via SSH:

```bash
ssh srv-d089jj7diees73934ka0@ssh.ohio.render.com
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Application Directory

```bash
cd /app/server
```

### Step 3: Trigger Webhooks

Use the webhook trigger script to replay webhooks for events after a specific timestamp:

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.webhook_trigger "YYYY-MM-DD"
```

#### Accepted Date Formats

The script accepts three date formats:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Date Only
uv run python -m scripts.webhook_trigger "2025-10-07"
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  The date parameter is required. The script will trigger webhooks for **all events created after** the specified timestamp.
</Warning>

### Step 4: Monitor Execution

The script will:
1. Query for webhook events created after the specified timestamp
2. Retry delivery for each event

Monitor the output for any errors or failed deliveries.

## Verification

After triggering webhooks, verify that https://worker-dramatiq.onrender.com/webhooks is returning status "ok".

## Post-Procedure

- [ ] Document the webhook trigger in the on-call log
- [ ] Confirm webhook delivery with the merchant

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Script shows: No module named scripts.webhook_trigger">
    Make sure you're using the correct command format with `-m`:
    ```bash
    uv run python -m scripts.webhook_trigger "YYYY-MM-DD"
    ```
    **Not** `scripts/webhook_trigger` or `scripts.webhook_triegger` (note spelling).
